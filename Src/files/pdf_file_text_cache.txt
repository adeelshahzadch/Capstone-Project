The AI Adaptation Landscape
Where Does RAG Fit in Your AI Strategy?
● Need fresh, proprietary knowledge
● Don't want to retrain models
● Cost-effective scaling
Our focus today

What is RAG?
Retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) is a 
pattern that augments an LLM by retrieving 
relevant information from external sources at 
query time and injecting it into the prompt.

Why RAG Matters?
● Fresh Additional Knowledge. RAG lets 
you ground answers in recent 
documents, internal wikis, or databases 
without retraining models.
● Better Accuracy. By retrieving 
authoritative evidence, the model 
generates more accurate answers and 
can cite sources.
● Adaptable. Effectively handles novel and 
niche queries that weren't in the model's 
training data.
● Increases Efﬁciency. RAG grounds 
prompts with smaller, targeted chunks of 
information that streamline retrieval and 
generation.

Chunking -  The Critical Decision
Why Chunking Matters
LLMs have limited context windows (32k-200k 
tokens). Large documents must be divided into 
smaller pieces.
The Challenge:
● Too large → loses specificity, poor retrieval
● Too small → loses context, fragmented 
information

Three Main Chunking Strategies
Strategy How It Works Pros Cons When to Use
Fixed-Size Split at 512 
tokens, 15% 
overlap
Simple, fast, 
predictable
May break 
mid-sentence
General purpose, 
starting point
Semantic Use ML to 
identify coherent 
units
Preserves 
meaning, high 
accuracy
More compute, 
slower
Technical docs, 
complex content
Recursive Split using 
separators (\n\n, 
\n, space) 
repeatedly until 
desired size
Respects 
structure, better 
boundaries
More complex 
than ﬁxed-size
Documents with 
headings, 
paragraphs

RAG real world use cases
● AI Chatbots: RAG provides accurate answers from internal 
knowledge bases (e.g., support wikis, legal documents).  OpenAI 
emphasises that RAG is valuable when the content is not part of 
the base model’s knowledge .
● Search & discovery: Search systems combine keyword and 
vector search to surface relevant documents in e‑commerce, 
research and legal discovery.
● AI Copilots: Tools like Supabase AI Copilots use vector 
databases to ground responses in proprietary data and maintain 
multi‑tenant isolation .
● Long‑context reasoning: Databricks’ long‑context benchmark 
shows that Google’s Gemini 2.5 models can maintain consistent 
performance on RAG tasks up to two million tokens (longer than 
most models), whereas OpenAI’s GPT 5 models achieve 
state‑of‑the‑art accuracy up to 128k tokens .

Common Challenges
● Chunking & context windows: If chunks are poorly deﬁned, the retrieved information may miss critical context 
or include too much irrelevant text.  Research by Analytics Vidhya notes that ﬁxed‑size chunking can break 
context while semantic‑based chunking preserves meaning but requires more compute .
● Model context length: Models can only ingest a ﬁnite number of tokens.  Databricks’ benchmark observed that 
performance of LLMs like Llama‑3.1 and GPT‑4 starts to degrade when context windows exceed 32–64 k tokens 
.
● Retrieval quality: The quality of the vector database and retrieval algorithm determines recall.  Missing relevant 
documents leads to hallucinated answers.
● Latency & cost: Large vector databases and embedding models can be expensive and introduce latency.

Don’ts
🆇 Rely solely on vector search
🆇 Ignore security and access controls
🆇 Overload the LLM context window
🆇 Neglect continuous updates
🆇 Skip evaluation frameworks
Do’s
✅
 Start simple, iterate based on metrics
✅
 Use metadata ﬁltering (product, language, 
permissions)
✅
 Combine vector + keyword search (hybrid approach)
✅
 Monitor retrieval quality (recall@k, precision)
✅
 Keep embeddings synchronized with documents
✅
 Evaluate with domain-speciﬁc questions

✅
 Chunk size: 512 tokens
✅
 Chunk overlap: 15% (~75 tokens)
✅
 Top-k retrieval: 3-5 chunks
✅
 Embedding dimensions: 768-1536
Default Conﬁguration 
(Works for 80% of cases):
17
✅
 RAG = Open-book exam for AI -  Retrieves external knowledge at query time
✅
 Chunking is critical -  Start with 512 tokens, 15% overlap, then iterate
✅
 Hybrid search > vector-only -  Combine vector and keyword search
✅
 Start simple -  Use Chroma + LangChain for learning, scale as needed
✅
 Always evaluate -  Track recall, precision, and answer quality
